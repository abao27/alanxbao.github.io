![coindungeon](/vid/coindungeon.mp4)

**Skills**: Java, Graphic Design

"Coin Dungeon" is a mini-game I coded using Java and the edu.princeton.cs.algs4 package. The goal of the game is simple: to collect all of the coins in the randomly-generated labyrinth. Some key features include:
- WASD navigation
- Toggle light on/off
- Save game state
- Replay

In the demo above, I enter a seed and start the game, which generates a random world. I then toggle dark and light mode with the "I" and "O" keys, and proceed to collect all the coins. After all the coins are collected, a win screen pops up.

**Skills**: JavaScript, Data Analysis, Research

TaxTools is a static website designed in a small project team in my club, Political CS @ Berkeley. This website visualizes tax data based on user settings and simulates one's savings and retirement. I mainly had a backend role in this project, where I researched and analyzed US Government financial data to write functions that calculated one's taxes and finances.

In this demo, I play around with different settings (Fiscal Year, Marital Status, Tax Credit) to see how much I would get taxed with an annual income of $50,000. I then visualized the breakdown of my tax spending with the pie chart. Finally, I used the savings and investment simulator to simulate my savings by 2065.

![Terminal Snake](/vid/snake.mp4)

**Skills**: C

This version of the classic snake is simple and playable in your terminal! For this project, I coded the functions and classes that defined the snake and its movements. I also worked on memory management, which was necessary for efficient updating, saving and loading game states. However, instead of using graphics, unicode characters were used to visualize the game. The notation of characters are defined below:
- *WASD* - The head of the snake corresponding with the direction its facing.
- *wasd* - The tail of the snake corresponding with the direction its facing.
- *^\<v\>* - The body of the snake corresponding with the direction its facing.
- *\** - The apple the snake wants to eat.
- *#* - The borders/walls of the world.

In the short snippet of the game demo above, I use the WASD keys to navigate the snake in the world map and eat the apples. When my snake's head crashed into its body, it dies and the game ends.

**Skills**: CPU, Assembly (RISC-V), Logic Circuits

In this project for my computer architecture class (CS61C), I built a simple 2-stage pipelined CPU that runs RISC-V instructions in Logisim. This challenged and tested my understanding of the RISC-V Datapath and logic circuits.

Due to course policy, there is no demo, but a list of runnable instructions are enumerated below. Note that all instructions are signed unless specified otherwise.
