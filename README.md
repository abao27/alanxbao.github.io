## Projects
### Coin Dungeon
"Coin Dungeon" is a mini-game I coded using Java and the edu.princeton.cs.algs4 package. The goal of the game is simple: to collect all of the coins in the randomly-generated labyrinth. Some key features of Coin Dungeon include:
- WASD navigation
- Toggle light on/off
- Save game state
- Replay

In the demo below, I enter a seed and start the game, which generates a random world. I then toggle dark and light mode with the "I" and "O" keys, and proceed to collect all the coins. After all the coins are collected, a win screen pops up.
