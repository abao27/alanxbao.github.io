### Coin Dungeon
Skills: Java, Graphic Design

"Coin Dungeon" is a mini-game I coded using Java and the edu.princeton.cs.algs4 package. The goal of the game is simple: to collect all of the coins in the randomly-generated labyrinth. Some key features include:
- WASD navigation
- Toggle light on/off
- Save game state
- Replay

In the demo below, I enter a seed and start the game, which generates a random world. I then toggle dark and light mode with the "I" and "O" keys, and proceed to collect all the coins. After all the coins are collected, a win screen pops up.

### TaxTools
Skills: JavaScript, Data Analysis, Research

TaxTools is a static website designed in a small project team in my club, Political CS @ Berkeley. This website visualizes tax data based on user settings and simulates one's savings and retirement. I mainly had a backend role in this project, where I researched and analyzed US Government financial data to write functions that calculated one's taxes and finances.

In this demo, I play around with different settings (Fiscal Year, Marital Status, Tax Credit) to see how much I would get taxed with an annual income of $50,000. I then visualized the breakdown of my tax spending with the pie chart. Finally, I used the savings and investment simulator to simulate my savings by 2065.
